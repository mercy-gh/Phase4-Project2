# 1 Business Understanding

## 1.0 Overview
With the rapid expansion of internet streaming platforms, users are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available movies. Providing personalized recommendations is critical for increasing user engagement, satisfaction, and retention. The MovieLens (ml-latest-small) dataset, rom [MovieLens](http://movielens.org) (a movie recommendation service),  includes user-generated 5-star ratings and free-text tags that can be used to create a powerful recommendation engine.


## 1.1 Problem Statement
With thousands of movies accessible on streaming platforms, customers struggle to discover ones they'll like. This choice overload frequently results in dissatisfaction, decision fatigue, and low user engagement.
Many systems rely on generic rankings or trending lists that do not consider individual preferences. This leads to irrelevant movie suggestions that do not match user preferences, longer search times lower user happiness, or low retention rates due to users potentially switching to competitors with better recommendations.

The goal is to create a movie recommendation system that can predict user preferences based on previous interactions. Specifically, we want to:

## 1.2 Objectives
*   &#x2611; Analyze user ratings and tags to find patterns and trends.
*   &#x2611; Create a recommendation model that incorporates collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
*   &#x2611; Address critical issues such as data scarcity, cold start issues, and bias in user ratings.
*   &#x2611; Assess model performance using relevant measures such as RMSE, MAE, and Precision@K.

## 1.3 Proposed solution
The objective is to examine and use the dataset to boost user engagement by developing a movie recommendation engine. Potential applications include:

&#x2611; Personalized **Movie Recommendations** - Predict user preferences based on previous ratings.

&#x2611; Customize content by **segmenting and clustering users** based on similar preferences.

&#x2611; **Trend Analysis and Insights**: Discover popular genres, top-rated movies, and viewing behaviors.

&#9745; Tag-based **sentiment analysis** provides insights into user perception of movies.


&#x2713; **Next Steps**

&#x2A39; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand rating distributions, popular tags, and trends.

&#x2A3B; Feature Engineering – Transform text tags into meaningful numerical features.

&#x2A39; Model Selection – Choose between collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.

&#x2A3B; Evaluation Metrics – Use RMSE, MAE, or Precision@K to assess recommendation performance.


### Challenges & Considerations
* Data Sparsity: Not all users have rated all movies, leading to gaps in the dataset.
* Cold Start Problem: New users/movies lack enough data for accurate recommendations.
* Bias in Ratings: Some users may consistently rate higher or lower than others.
* Scalability: The model should be efficient enough to handle large datasets in real-world applications.
